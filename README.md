This is the API documentation for a full-stack web project I developed, which I call Phone Store.

Phone Store is a web application that enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on a phone (or product) store.

So this API documentation details the several endpoints (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE) that make CRUD operations on the store possible.

This API documentation is OpenAPI-compliant and fully testable in Swagger UI.

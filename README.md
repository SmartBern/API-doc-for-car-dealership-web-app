This is the API documentation for a full-stack car dealership web app I developed, which I call JustCars.

JustCars is a web application that enables users to create an account, log in, search cars (by year, brand, or model), and filter new and pre-owned cars by brand.

The API documentation of JustCars details the several endpoints (multiple GETs and POSTs) that facilitate the aforementioned user operations on the web app.

JustCars API documentation is OpenAPI-compliant and fully testable in Swagger UI.
